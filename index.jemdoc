*About Me*\n

Welcome to my homepage!

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research from [https://msande.stanford.edu the Department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E)] at [https://www.stanford.edu Stanford University], advised by [https://joseblanchet.com Prof. Jose Blanchet].
Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Probability and Statistics from the [http://en.ustc.edu.cn University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)].

*Research Interests*\n

My research centers around reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, I am excited by the power of RL in advancing LLM agents.

With backgrounds in probability and statistics, my past research includes mathematical theory and algorithm design of provably sample-efficient RL, training dynamics and generalization properties in deep learning loss landscapes, and RL for operations and economics.
